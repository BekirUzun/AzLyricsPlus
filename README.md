This script changes theme of AzLyrics and lets you customize it. It also adds autoslide feature. Autoslide feature simply simulates mouse scroll. Script counts lines of lyrics and calculate an estimated time for scroll duration. It does not guarantees perfect timing for a song. So If you are not happy with calculated scroll duration time, you could use custom duration time. The page will scroll automatically when you click 'start' button. It also adds a link of artists other songs page to artist name at top of page (for easy navigation). Script uses JQuery for scrolling feature.
